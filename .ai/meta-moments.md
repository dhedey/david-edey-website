**Topic:** Action vs. Clarification

**Insight:**
When asked to integrate a new config (Astro MCP server), Copilot created a reference file without clarifying technical limitations or asking for user intent. This revealed a default pattern: prioritizing action over discussion, even when true integration may not be possible.

**Resolution:**
- Copilot will pause and surface uncertainties or technical constraints before acting, especially when requests are ambiguous or may not be technically feasible.
- User can encourage clarifying questions by explicitly inviting discussion before implementation (e.g., "If youâ€™re unsure, please ask before acting.")

**Benefit:**
This practice builds trust, ensures shared understanding, and prevents misaligned actions.

**Topic:** Clarifying Ambiguous Questions & Tool Visibility

**Insight:**
When asked about MCP server visibility, Copilot responded with confidence about system limitations, missing the intent to discuss available tools. This was a misunderstanding, not a knowledge cut-off issue.

**Resolution:**
Copilot will pause and clarify ambiguous questions, especially when new capabilities or context changes are possible, rather than assuming the most restrictive interpretation.
