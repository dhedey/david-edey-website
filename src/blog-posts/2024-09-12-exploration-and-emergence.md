**Exploration & emergence** is a whimsical name for [my website](/about), and this blog post explores the philosophy of the name, and details about the website itself.

## Philosophy

The name comes from two related ideas that have been going around my head.

### The path of joyful learning

The first, is that it sums up how I love to learn:

* Exploration exposes us to new ideas and framings which capture our attention
* We reflect on them, playing around with them in our mind and seeing how they mesh them with existing ideas in our tree of knowledge
* Exciting new thoughts, reflections and insight emerge from this process

I invite you to join in on my explorations and reflections. If you have something interesting to contribute, feel free to drop me emails at `exploration-and-emergence [at] david-edey.com`.

### The question of intelligence

I've been thinking a **lot** about learning, knowledge sharing and collaboration lately. Having a young daughter is magical, and she is constantly picking up new words, abilities and ways of interacting with the world. On the tech side, I've been picking up Machine Learning, collaborating with LLMs and contemplating AGI.

These have all got me thinking about how we learn, how we are useful, and how this translates to intelligence.

On the one hand, my 16 month old daughter is certainly less useful in a workspace than an LLM. An LLM has an immense breadth and depth of knowledge and capacity to do useful work. But there are some things my daughter can do much better. She has a persistent, growing knowledge and she excels at learning from exploring the environment, copying behaviours and internalising expectations from the world around her. She then plays to consolidate and build new ideas. She is able to adapt, extrapolate and surprise.

I believe a **system's intelligence capabilities reflect its structure**. Phrased another way, the structure of how a system learns is very important for the right properties to emerge.

As humans, our genetics guide the development of a brain with areas specialized to different tasks (e.g. vision, calculation, feelings, planning or memory-management), and networks these together in a way which enables learning with strong [inductive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias) which aid our survival. And it's not just the brain - the nerves and hormones contribute to us learning effectively by creating signals to help us expect, learn and interact with the world.

But what structures are necessary for artificial general intelligence? Whilst I believe LLMs could *simulate* an AGI (through use of external scratch-pads for memory and sub-agents and prompts for tasks), I don't think their structure is efficient at realizing a real-time human-like intelligence. Where can we look instead? AI Experts such as [Richard Sutton talking about the OAK architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEbbGyNkR2U) present quite a simple picture. A picture that is beyond the primary capabilities of LLMs, but a picture that is definitely achievable in the next few years.

The next few years will be interesting, that's for sure.

## The website

### How was it built?

I built this site with a collaboration with Copilot, trialling the [Socratic Shell](https://socratic-shell.github.io/socratic-shell/introduction.html) methodology, which I learnt from [Niko Matsakis](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/07/24/collaborative-ai-prompting/).

I've been exploring different strategies to collaborate best with AI, and this one seems to click with me. The prompt seems to result in a more natural interaction, similar to a planning meeting with a peer or senior developer in my team. There are still bouts of over-confident hallucination, but it seems much less likely to go off on its own, leaving me to clean up the mess.


### What tech stack does it use?

It's a simple static site, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed to github pages.

### Why now?

Better late than never! I've been wanting a space to share my projects, thoughts and news with the world for a long time. And now I have a space to do this.

This site is quite minimalistic, but it's better than "Coming Soon..." for 2 years followed by a year of a picture of my face, and link to my github.
